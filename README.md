# Deadline Timer ‚è∞

**Deadline Time** is a simple Python program developed by Ricky X in April 2023.

This program allows you to easily **track the time remaining** between `current_time` and `your_deadline`, helping you manage your time effectively and meet your deadlines



## Run

1. Python environment have to be installed on your machine
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/Ricky2333/Deadline-Timer.git` in your teminal to clone the repository
3. Change your working direcotry to the `code` folder of the repository and run `main.py`

```python
cd code
python main.py
```



## Modules

Here are some modules that I use in this program (All of them are Python built-in modules, you don't need to install them)

- `datetime`
  - This is the key module in this program, which provides `datetime` object to deal with time
- `time`
  - This module provides `sleep` to improve the interactive experience by adding delays between program actions
- `re`
  - This module enables us to use **regular expression** in Python to check if the user input is in a valid time format
